# <h1> Porfolio of Gonçalo Pereira </h1>
This is the repository of the portfolio that i create to share myself as a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>.<br>
The portfolio was fully created using vanilla <strong>HTML, CSS and JS</strong> since it was also used for a college work that i had to do.<br>
This project cannot be modified by others, only by the admin.<br><br>
<strong>Thanks</strong>, <em>Gonçalo Pereira</em>.
